    5. Leo and Ted's
  </h3>
  
  <h4>
    This newly opened coffee shop is an imalgimation of Leo's Beanary and Ted's bakehouse, both Edinburgh staples. And together, well it's a match made in heaven! 
    Based on Leven Street in Brunstfield, just near the Meadows, Leo and Ted's is a small but very well-formed coffee shop, with a few tables and a really great menu. There are always lovely baked goods on offer, along with a couple of soups, some bagels, sandwiches and great, great coffee!
